One is precision. We want to choose an anchor that we are pretty sure is correct, meaning that it does contribute heavily to the prediction of the black box model. The other is coverage, meaning that our anchor still holds for as big of a subset of the input space as possible, which in practice generally means trying to make the anchor more concise. The algorithm optimizes this by setting a precision threshold, and choosing the anchor above this precision with the highest coverage. In order to generate this anchor, we start off with a null rule, and then iteratively add features to it until we have a rule that meets the precision threshold we are looking for. We start off with multiple possible rules to make sure we search a reasonably sized portion of the sample space while keeping the algorithm computationally feasible (Ribeiro et al, 2018). One weakness of anchoring is the difficulty of finding a distribution within which to perturb data (the same problem shows up in LIME and is somewhat inherent to perturbation based algorithms). Another issue is that there is no good anchor for some data points, especially ones near decision boundaries or belonging to fringe classes."}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["To implement anchoring, we used ",(0,o.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://github.com/marcotcr/anchor",children:"Ribeiro's Anchoring Package"})]})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,n.M)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},2172:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{I:()=>r,M:()=>s});var o=i(1504);const n={},a=o.createContext(n);function s(e){const t=o.useContext(a);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:s(e.components),o.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
