# ResNet

## Can you explain your answer?

(Introduce ResNet as an ML model that predicts a class based on an image input. Also introduce cats/dogs dataset, and how LIME can explain ResNet's predictions using an easier example)

## Cartons and Vipers and Bears, oh my!

(talk about how LIME can explain some of the wackier ResNet predictions)

## What does this tell us about LIME?

(speak more generally about LIME and how it interacts with the dataset from a critical analysis pov)
