# Introduction

Two user studies were run. Each study consisted of one on one interviews with around 12 participants and took around 20 minutes to complete. Both studies shared the same introduction to the concept of XAI, and conclusion which gauge participant trust and preference for each model. The goals of the study was to:
- Explore the usability of the three XAI techniques by individuals without a background in XAI (like a jury, for instance).
- Compare the three XAI techniques in terms of usability and trustworthiness.
- And explore how XAI techniques modify perception of the underlying model.
