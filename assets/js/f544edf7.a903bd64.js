Given a 2-dimensional slice of an MRI scan (horizontal, sagittal, or coronal), the model guessed whether the person's brain had either a brain tumor of the glioma, meningioma, or pituitary varieties. Of course, some brains had no tumors at all. After a few weeks of tinkering, we were able to get a neural network running with a 60-70%ish success rate; not the worst model ever, even if you wouldn't trust it for a surgery. But, it remained to be seen if the explainable AI techniques agreed that the model was good and was just making understandable mistakes, or whether it was lost looking at metaphorical sand."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.M)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},2172:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{I:()=>i,M:()=>r});var o=n(1504);const s={},a=o.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=o.useContext(a);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),o.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
