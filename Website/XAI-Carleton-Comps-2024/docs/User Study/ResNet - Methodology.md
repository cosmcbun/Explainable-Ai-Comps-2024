# Methodology of the ResNet user study
We designed a user study to determine how explanatory – and convincing – our explanations of ResNet predictions were to a group of Carleton students. We selected 12 students,
... work in progress


We conducted a user study to see which
techniques were favored. The participants
were twelve college students, seven of
whom were CS majors.
• Participants were shown an image of a cat
or dog and the model’s prediction for the
image, then shown three different
explanations for the model’s prediction

After showing the participant the prediction
and explanation, we asked whether each
explanation helped or hurt their
understanding of the model.
• After showing them eight images, we asked
them which technique they liked the best
overall.
