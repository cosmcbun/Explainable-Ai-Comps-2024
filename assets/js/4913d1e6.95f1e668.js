Instead, LIME builds its simple model on a novel dataset created by passing slightly modified versions of the input which LIME seeks to explain into the black-box model. These perturbed data are weighted based on their proximity to the black box models prediction of interest. Exploring the simple model's inherently interpretable nature allows a user to explore why the black box model gave a specific output."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"LIME shares many of the same challenges with Anchor XAI technique (and Shapley Value AI technique to a lesser degree). For each run, LIME only attempts to explain a specific result in isolation. This means that LIME can give massively different explanations across multiple runs on similar black box model results. Similarly, given two black box models who give identical results for a particular input, LIME might give massively different explanations for how each model came to its conclusion. This is not an inherent limitation of LIME (the black box model might really have massively different rationale for two similar outputs or two models may come to the same conclusion based on massively different logic) but this local interpretation may prevent insights gain through LIME from being applied to a general understanding of the black box model. Lastly, as with most XAI methods, LIME takes significant computational resources: for each black box model conclusion a user wishes to explain, a new ML model must be substantiated."})]})}function p(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.M)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},2172:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{I:()=>l,M:()=>s});var n=o(1504);const i={},a=n.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(a);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function l(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),n.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
