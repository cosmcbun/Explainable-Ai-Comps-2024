As discussed in Ribeiro et al. (2016, p.1), the act of explaining an AI\u2019s prediction presents the audience with visualizations pertaining to the actions it made to achieve such a decision, thus building users\u2019 trust in the model and exposing any possible errors in the model\u2019s structure. With regulations like the EU\u2019s Right to Explainability and the United States\u2019 proposed AI Bill of Rights, a machine learning model may no longer be a simple \u201cblack box\u201d: in order to prevent criminal charges, the creators of high-impact models must be able to justify each of their predictions. Over the past few years, the field has thus become inundated with approaches, each a bid for its own niche. In such an impossibly dense field, how can one quantify a method\u2019s efficacy? Which method would a jury trust?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/What do our techniques explain":{"id":"Introduction/What do our techniques explain","title":"What is post hoc explanation?","description":"so like... u run the model and then you see why it did that","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/What is XAI":{"id":"Introduction/What is XAI","title":"What is XAI?","description":"Lorem ipsum and whatnot.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"LIME/Introduction":{"id":"LIME/Introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"LIME/ResNet":{"id":"LIME/ResNet","title":"ResNet","description":"Can you explain your answer?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Methodology/User Study":{"id":"Methodology/User Study","title":"User Study","description":"It is of primary importance that the group understands our three explainable AI methods.
